====================
Packaging on Windows
====================
Need to install pyinstaller
PathToPython.exe -m pip install pyinstaller
C:\Python27\python.exe -m pip install pyinstaller

Converting the .py file to an executable
# package all into --onefile
C:\Python27\Scripts\pyinstaller.exe reverse_backdoor.py --onefile 
# Donâ€™t show the console once program is run
C:\Python27\Scripts\pyinstaller.exe reverse_backdoor.py --onefile --noconsole

! When packaging a program that uses multiple libraries its important that you have the library installed on the same PC that is packaging it.

====================
Packaging on Linux
====================
# Had to run to get wine to work it was a big download
https://wiki.debian.org/Wine
dpkg --add-architecture i386 && apt-get update && apt-get install wine32
CD into .wine/drive_c/Python27/
wine python.exe -m pip install pyinstaller

Had to run this when packaging the keylogger with an external library on the Linux machine using wine and making the exe for windows machine.
wine /root/.wine/drive_c/Python27/python.exe -m pip install pynput
wine /root/.wine/drive_c/Python27/Scripts/pyinstaller.exe zlogger.py --onefile --noconsole
